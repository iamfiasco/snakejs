# snakejs
1970s classic game snake in pure JS

Its a simple implementation of snake just open the html file in browser and make sure the js file is in the same directory. Just dont use
very old browser as it might not work. Nah just kidding HTML canvas works fine everywhere. You may also require to change the canvas size if
your screen size is small.
